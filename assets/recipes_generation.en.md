# 🏋🏻‍ I've trained Recurrent Neural Network to generate recipes, and it suggested me to cook 🥤 Cream Soda with 🧅 Onions

# A step-by-step guide on how to generate recipes using TensorFlow and Recurrent Neural Network

## TL;DR

I've trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on _~100k_ recipes using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Here is what I ended up with:

- 🎨 [Recipes generator demo](https://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments/#/experiments/RecipeGenerationRNN)
- 🏋🏻‍ [Model training process](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/blob/master/experiments/recipe_generation_rnn/recipe_generation_rnn.ipynb)

This article contains details of model training with TensorFlow code examples (Python).

## Experiment overview

I'm a complete beginner in Machine Learning 👶🏻. Creating a _Recipe Generator_ was yet another attempt to play around with _Recurrent Neural Networks_ in my [🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) repository and to learn how those RNNs are implemented in TensorFlow in particular.

I was curious to see:

- what weird recipes names and ingredients combination the RNN would suggest
- will it learn that each recipe consists of several blocks (name, ingredients, cooking instructions)
- will it learn English grammar and punctuation from scratch just for several hours of training (I wish I had this skill)

I decided to experiment with **character-based RNN** this time. It means that I will not teach my RNN to understand words and sentences but rather to understand letters and theirs sequences.




In this experiment we will use character-based [Recurrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNN) to generate cooking recipes. We will try to teach our RNN to generate recipe _name_, _ingredients_ and _cooking instructions_ for us.

I don't expect the RNN to do a strong connection between list of ingredients and cooking instructions but I do expect RNN to learn English grammar and punctuation in couple of hours and to generate some meaningful recipe names along with real food ingredients and cooking instructions.

For this experiment we will use [Tensorflow v2](https://www.tensorflow.org/) with its [Keras API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras).

⚠️ _The recipes in this notebook are generated just for fun and for learning purposes. The recipes are **not** for actual cooking!_

## Exploring datasets

Let's go through several available dataset and explore their pros and cons. One of the requirement I want the dataset to meet is that it should have not only a list of ingredients but also a cooking instruction. I also want it to have a measures and quantities of each ingredient.

- 🤷 [Recipe Ingredients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset/home) _(doesn't have ingredients proportions)_
- 🤷 [Recipe1M+](http://pic2recipe.csail.mit.edu/) _(requires registration to download)_
- 🤷 [Epicurious - Recipes with Rating and Nutrition](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes?select=full_format_recipes.json) _(~20k recipes only, it would be nice to find more)_
- 👍🏻 [**Recipe box**](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/) _(~125,000 recipes with ingredients proportions, good)_

## Importing dependencies

@TODO: Explain why do we need these dependencies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import platform
import time
import pathlib
import os
import json
import zipfile
```

```python
print('Python version:', platform.python_version())
print('Tensorflow version:', tf.__version__)
print('Keras version:', tf.keras.__version__)
```

```
Python version: 3.7.6
Tensorflow version: 2.1.0
Keras version: 2.2.4-tf
```

## Loading the dataset

Let's load the dataset using [tf.keras.utils.get_file](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/get_file). Using `get_file()` utility is convenient because it handles caching for you out of the box. It means that you will download the dataset files only once and then even if you launch the same code block once again it will use cache and the download code will be executed faster.

```python
# Create cache folder.
cache_dir = './tmp'
pathlib.Path(cache_dir).mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

```python
# Download and unpack the dataset.
dataset_file_name = 'recipes_raw.zip'
dataset_file_origin = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/recipe-box/recipes_raw.zip'

dataset_file_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file(
    fname=dataset_file_name,
    origin=dataset_file_origin,
    cache_dir=cache_dir,
    extract=True,
    archive_format='zip'
)

print(dataset_file_path)
```

```
./tmp/datasets/recipes_raw.zip
```

```bash
!ls -la ./tmp/datasets/
```

```
total 521128

```

As you may see, the dataset consists of 3 files. We need to merge information from those 3 files into one dataset later.

Let's download a datasets and preview examples from them.

```python
def load_dataset(silent=False):
    dataset_file_names = [
        'recipes_raw_nosource_ar.json',
        'recipes_raw_nosource_epi.json',
        'recipes_raw_nosource_fn.json',
    ]
    
    dataset = []

    for dataset_file_name in dataset_file_names:
        dataset_file_path = f'{cache_dir}/datasets/{dataset_file_name}'

        with open(dataset_file_path) as dataset_file:
            json_data_dict = json.load(dataset_file)
            json_data_list = list(json_data_dict.values())
            dict_keys = [key for key in json_data_list[0]]
            dict_keys.sort()
            dataset += json_data_list

            if silent == False:
                print(dataset_file_path)
                print('===========================================')
                print('Number of examples: ', len(json_data_list), '\n')
                print('Example object keys:\n', dict_keys, '\n')

                print('  instructions: ', json_data_list[0]['instructions'])
                print('\n\n')

    return dataset

## Preprocessing the dataset

### Filtering out incomplete examples

```python
# Filters out recipes which don't have either title or ingredients or instructions.
def recipe_validate_required_fields(recipe):
    required_keys = ['title', 'ingredients', 'instructions']
    
    if not recipe:
        return False
    
    for required_key in required_keys:
        if not recipe[required_key]:
            return False
        
        if type(recipe[required_key]) == list and len(recipe[required_key]) == 0:
            return False
    
    return True
```

```
dataset_validated = [recipe for recipe in dataset_raw if recipe_validate_required_fields(recipe)]

print('Dataset size BEFORE validation', len(dataset_raw))
print('Dataset size AFTER validation', len(dataset_validated))
print('Number of invalide recipes', len(dataset_raw) - len(dataset_validated))
```

```
Dataset size BEFORE validation 125164
Dataset size AFTER validation 122938
Number of invalide recipes 2226
```

### Converting recipes objects into strings

To help our RNN learn the structure of the text let's add 3 "landmarks" to it. We will use these unique "title", "ingredients" and "instruction" landmarks to separate a logic sections of each recipe.

```python
STOP_WORD_TITLE = '📗 '
STOP_WORD_INGREDIENTS = '\n🥕\n\n'
STOP_WORD_INSTRUCTIONS = '\n📝\n\n'
```

```python
# Converts recipe object to string (sequence of characters) for later usage in RNN input.
def recipe_to_string(recipe):
    # This string is presented as a part of recipes so we need to clean it up.
    noize_string = 'ADVERTISEMENT'
    
    title = recipe['title']
    ingredients = recipe['ingredients']
    instructions = recipe['instructions'].split('\n')
    
    ingredients_string = ''
    for ingredient in ingredients:
        ingredient = ingredient.replace(noize_string, '')
        if ingredient:
            ingredients_string += f'• {ingredient}\n'
    
    instructions_string = ''
    for instruction in instructions:
        instruction = instruction.replace(noize_string, '')
        if instruction:
            instructions_string += f'▪︎ {instruction}\n'
    
    return f'{STOP_WORD_TITLE}{title}\n{STOP_WORD_INGREDIENTS}{ingredients_string}{STOP_WORD_INSTRUCTIONS}{instructions_string}'
```

```python
dataset_stringified = [recipe_to_string(recipe) for recipe in dataset_validated]

print('Stringified dataset size: ', len(dataset_stringified))
```

```
Stringified dataset size:  122938
```

```python
for recipe_index, recipe_string in enumerate(dataset_stringified[:10]):
    print('Recipe #{}\n---------'.format(recipe_index + 1))
    print(recipe_string)
    print('\n')
```

• 1/2 teaspoon salt
• 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
• 1 tablespoon olive oil
• 1 medium carrot, cut into 1/8-inch dice
• 1 medium celery rib, cut into 1/8-inch dice
• 1 (15- to 16-ounces) can small white beans, rinsed and drained
• 1 1/2 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth
• 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
• 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
• 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chervil (optional)
• Garnish: fresh chervil sprigs

📝

▪︎ Cook haricots verts in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water, then drain. Add edamame to boiling water and cook 4 minutes. Drain in a colander, then rinse under cold water. If using edamame in pods, shell them and discard pods. Cook onion, garlic, bay leaf, rosemary, salt, and pepper in oil in a 2- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add carrot and celery and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add white beans and stock and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Add haricots verts and edamame and simmer, uncovered, until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add butter, parsley, and chervil (if using) and stir gently until butter is melted. Discard bay leaf and rosemary sprigs.

### Filtering out large receipts

Recipes have different lengths. We need to have one hard-coded sequence length limit before feeding recipes sequences to RNN. We need to find out what recipe length will cover most of recipe use-cases and at the same time we want to keep it as small as possible for training performance.

```python
recipes_lengths = []
for recipe_text in dataset_stringified:
    recipes_lengths.append(len(recipe_text))
```

```python
plt.hist(recipes_lengths, bins=50)
plt.show()
```

![Recipes lengths 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/master/assets/images/recipes_generation/02-recipes-length.png)

```python
plt.hist(recipes_lengths, range=(0, 8000), bins=50)
plt.show()
```

![Recipes lengths 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/master/assets/images/recipes_generation/03-recipes-length.png)

```python
# Looks like a limit of 2000 characters for the recipes will cover 80+% cases.
# We may try to train RNN with this maximum recipe length limit.
MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH = 2000
```

```python
def filter_recipes_by_length(recipe_test):
    return len(recipe_test) <= MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH 
```

```python
dataset_filtered = [recipe_text for recipe_text in dataset_stringified if filter_recipes_by_length(recipe_text)]

print('Dataset size BEFORE filtering: ', len(dataset_stringified))
print('Dataset size AFTER filtering: ', len(dataset_filtered))
print('Number of etiminated recipes: ', len(dataset_stringified) - len(dataset_filtered))
```

```
Dataset size BEFORE filtering:  122938
Dataset size AFTER filtering:  100212
Number of etiminated recipes:  22726
```

### Summarizing dataset parameters

```python
TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM = len(dataset_filtered)

print('MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH: ', MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH)
print('TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM: ', TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM)
```

```
MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH:  2000
TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM:  100212
```

## Creating vocabulary

To create a vocabulary out of recipes texts we will use [tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text/Tokenizer)

```python
# Indicator of the end of the recipe.
STOP_SIGN = '␣'
```

```python
tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(
    char_level=True,
    filters='',
    lower=False,
    split=''
)
```

```python
# Stop word is not a part of recipes, but tokenizer must know about it as well.
tokenizer.fit_on_texts([STOP_SIGN])
```

```python
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(dataset_filtered)
```

```python
tokenizer.get_config()
```

```

## Vectorizing the dataset

Now, once we have a vocabulary (`character --> code` and `code --> character` relations) we may convert the set of recipes from text to numbers (RNN works with numbers as an input and not with the texts).

```python
def recipe_sequence_to_string(recipe_sequence):
    recipe_stringified = tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([recipe_sequence])[0]
    recipe_stringified = recipe_stringified.replace('   ', '_').replace(' ', '').replace('_', ' ')
    print(recipe_stringified)
```

```python
dataset_vectorized = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(dataset_filtered)
```

```python
print('Vectorized dataset size', len(dataset_vectorized))
```

```
Vectorized dataset size 100212
```

```python
print(dataset_vectorized[0][:10], '...')
```

```
[51, 1, 33, 10, 5, 23, 1, 35, 5, 5] ...
```

```python
max_index_example = np.max(dataset_vectorized)

print('max_index_example: ', max_index_example)

### Add padding to sequences

We need all recipes to have the same length for training. To do that we'll use [tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/sequence/pad_sequences) utility to add a stop word to the end of each recipe and to make them have the same length.

```python
for recipe_index, recipe in enumerate(dataset_vectorized[:10]):
    print('Recipe #{} length: {}'.format(recipe_index + 1, len(recipe)))
```

```
Recipe #1 length: 546
Recipe #2 length: 401
Recipe #3 length: 671
Recipe #4 length: 736
Recipe #5 length: 1518
Recipe #6 length: 740
Recipe #7 length: 839
Recipe #8 length: 667
Recipe #9 length: 1264
Recipe #10 length: 854
```

```python
dataset_vectorized_padded_without_stops = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(
    dataset_vectorized,
    padding='post',
    truncating='post',
    # We use -1 here and +1 in the next step to make sure that all recipes will have at least 1 stops
    # sign at the end, since each sequence will be shifted and truncated afterwards (to generate X and Y sequences).
    maxlen=MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH-1,
    value=tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([STOP_SIGN])[0]
)

### Split examples on `input` and `target` texts

For each sequence, duplicate and shift it to form the input and target text. For example, say sequence_length is 4 and our text is `Hello`. The input sequence would be `Hell`, and the target sequence `ello`.

```python
def split_input_target(recipe):
    input_text = recipe[:-1]
    target_text = recipe[1:]
    
    return input_text, target_text
```

```python
dataset_targeted = dataset.map(split_input_target)

print(dataset_targeted)
```

```
<MapDataset shapes: ((2000,), (2000,)), types: (tf.int32, tf.int32)>
```

```python
for input_example, target_example in dataset_targeted.take(1):
    print('Input sequence size:', repr(len(input_example.numpy())))
    print('Target sequence size:', repr(len(target_example.numpy())))
    print()
    
    input_stringified = tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([input_example.numpy()[:50]])[0]
    target_stringified = tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([target_example.numpy()[:50]])[0]
    
    print('Input:  ', repr(''.join(input_stringified)))
    print('Target: ', repr(''.join(target_stringified)))
```

```
Input sequence size: 2000
Target sequence size: 2000

Input:   '📗   S l o w   C o o k e r   C h i c k e n   a n d   D u m p l i n g s \n \n 🥕 \n \n •   4   s k i n l e'
Target:  '  S l o w   C o o k e r   C h i c k e n   a n d   D u m p l i n g s \n \n 🥕 \n \n •   4   s k i n l e s'
```

Each index of these vectors are processed as one time step. For the input at time step 0, the model receives the index for `[` and tries to predict the index for `T` as the next character. At the next time-step, it does the same thing but the RNN considers the previous step context in addition to the current input character.

```python
for i, (input_idx, target_idx) in enumerate(zip(input_example[:10], target_example[:10])):
    print('Step {:2d}'.format(i + 1))
    print('  input: {} ({:s})'.format(input_idx, repr(tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([[input_idx.numpy()]])[0])))
    print('  expected output: {} ({:s})'.format(target_idx, repr(tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([[target_idx.numpy()]])[0])))
```

```
Step  1
  input: 51 ('📗')
  expected output: 1 (' ')
Step  2
  input: 1 (' ')
  expected output: 33 ('S')
Step  3
  input: 33 ('S')
  expected output: 10 ('l')
Step  4
  input: 10 ('l')
  expected output: 5 ('o')
Step  5
  input: 5 ('o')
  expected output: 23 ('w')
Step  6
  input: 23 ('w')
  expected output: 1 (' ')
Step  7
  input: 1 (' ')
  expected output: 35 ('C')
Step  8
  input: 35 ('C')
  expected output: 5 ('o')
Step  9
  input: 5 ('o')
  expected output: 5 ('o')
Step 10
  input: 5 ('o')
  expected output: 25 ('k')
```

- [tf.keras.layers.Embedding](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding): The input layer. A trainable lookup table that will map the numbers of each character to a vector with `embedding_dim` dimensions;
- [tf.keras.layers.LSTM](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM): A type of RNN with size units=rnn_units (You can also use a GRU layer here.)
- [tf.keras.layers.Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense): The output layer, with vocab_size outputs.

```python
# Let's do a quick detour and see how Embeding layer works.
# It takes several char indices sequences (batch) as an input.
# It encodes every character of every sequence to a vector of tmp_embeding_size length.
tmp_vocab_size = 10
tmp_embeding_size = 5
tmp_input_length = 8
tmp_batch_size = 2

tmp_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
tmp_model.add(tf.keras.layers.Embedding(
  input_dim=tmp_vocab_size,
  output_dim=tmp_embeding_size,
  input_length=tmp_input_length
))
# The model will take as input an integer matrix of size (batch, input_length).
# The largest integer (i.e. word index) in the input should be no larger than 9 (tmp_vocab_size).
# Now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 64), where None is the batch dimension.
tmp_input_array = np.random.randint(
  low=0,
  high=tmp_vocab_size,
  size=(tmp_batch_size, tmp_input_length)
)
tmp_model.compile('rmsprop', 'mse')
tmp_output_array = tmp_model.predict(tmp_input_array)

print('tmp_input_array shape:', tmp_input_array.shape)
print('tmp_input_array:')

vocab_size = VOCABULARY_SIZE

```

def build_model_1(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, batch_size):
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()

    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Embedding(
        input_dim=vocab_size,
        output_dim=embedding_dim,

For each character the model looks up the embedding, runs the LSTM one time-step with the embedding as input, and applies the dense layer to generate logits predicting the log-likelihood of the next character:

## Trying the model

```python
for input_example_batch, target_example_batch in dataset_train.take(1):
    example_batch_predictions = model_1(input_example_batch)
    print(example_batch_predictions.shape, "# (batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size)")
```

```
(64, 2000, 176) # (batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size)
```

To get actual predictions from the model we need to sample from the output distribution, to get actual character indices. This distribution is defined by the logits over the character vocabulary.

```python
print('Prediction for the 1st letter of the batch 1st sequense:')
print(example_batch_predictions[0, 0])
```

```
Prediction for the 1st letter of the batch 1st sequense:

## Generating text

### Restore the latest checkpoint

To keep this prediction step simple, use a batch size of 1.

Because of the way the RNN state is passed from timestep to timestep, the model only accepts a fixed batch size once built.

To run the model with a different `batch_size`, we need to rebuild the model and restore the weights from the checkpoint.


```python
tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir)
```




    'tmp/checkpoints/ckpt_13'




```python
# simplified_batch_size = 1
# model_1_simplified = build_model_1(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, simplified_batch_size)
# model_1_simplified.load_weights('recipe_generation_rnn.h5')
```


```python
simplified_batch_size = 1

model_1_simplified = build_model_1(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, simplified_batch_size)

model_1_simplified.load_weights(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir))

model_1_simplified.build(tf.TensorShape([simplified_batch_size, None]))
```


```python
model_1_simplified.summary()
```

### The prediction loop

The following code block generates the text:

- It Starts by choosing a start string, initializing the RNN state and setting the number of characters to generate.

- Get the prediction distribution of the next character using the start string and the RNN state.

- Then, use a categorical distribution to calculate the index of the predicted character. Use this predicted character as our next input to the model.

- The RNN state returned by the model is fed back into the model so that it now has more context, instead than only one character. After predicting the next character, the modified RNN states are again fed back into the model, which is how it learns as it gets more context from the previously predicted characters.

## Save the model


```python
model_name = 'recipe_generation_rnn.h5'
model_1_simplified.save(model_name, save_format='h5')
```

## Converting the model to web-format

To use this model on the web we need to convert it into the format that will be understandable by [tensorflowjs](https://www.tensorflow.org/js). To do so we may use [tfjs-converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter) as following:

```
tensorflowjs_converter --input_format keras \
  ./experiments/recipe_generation_rnn/recipe_generation_rnn.h5 \
  ./demos/public/models/recipe_generation_rnn
```

You find this experiment in the [Demo app](https://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments) and play around with it right in you browser to see how the model performs in real life.
